After a barrage of questions, including about the nature of the business, revenues, and other sources of income, I was denied. The denial was based on several factors. 1) I had too much available credit across my personal lines and was ""maxed out"" with Chase. 2) Business revenues were too low and I wasn't showing year-over-year growth.
Going into the call I had about 60k in available credit with Chase. I maintained I have an income of just over 100k. This was whittled down to around 70k by the CSR.

I was automatically denied. I called AMEX to find out why and was told it was because I had a returned payment.
This returned payment was due to my incorrectly setting up a bank account on one of my AMEX cards. I accidentally switched two numbers on my account, so when the auto-payment attempted, it was logged as returned. I called to fix it and they corrected the bank account information and the payment went through fine.
I was told by AMEX that it was automatically denied because of the returned payment. After explaining the situation and notifying them that I paid and was current and that it was just a mix up, she moved my application over to reconsideration and I will hear soon on the outcome. Will keep everyone posted.
Added Note: (this is known to many already but) I was told that they checked my AMEX history first and although I was denied I did not receive a HP.

Went stupid and applied for the SW for the companion pass but realized the points would post this calendar year and not the next one. Got denied for SW Premier and approved/right away close the SW Plus.

I called the recon for Carlson and said that I have been paying all my cards in full and not carrying a balance. My credit score is 750 on credit karma and utilization is around 3%. She was like we need to atleast see 6 months of credit payment history on those cards before we can reconsider it. I even said that I make trips to Europe and I like this card for its benefits.

Any help on what should I say when I call again in a few hours?

I called to check the automated status line again and it said that one of the apps was under review and I would hear back in 7-10 days. The other application still had the two weeks message. FYI, the automated line did not tell me which application corresponded to which card. So I waited about an hour or two and called the status line again. The first app had the 7-10 days message and the second app was approved! I called a Chase representative immediately and asked which card I had just been approved for. It was the Sapphire Reserve for $10k starting limit. I just got a $15k Capital One Venture card a couple weeks ago, but it's not on my credit report and all my other credit is under $5k, so that explains the low limit. I was denied for the Sapphire Preferred because too many recent requests for credit (basically because I was just approved for the Reserve). That was fine with me because I only wanted the Reserve anyway and applied for both for insurance. Also, since I applied within minutes of each other I only got 1 hard pull.

Paid card off in full every month, average utilization of around 70%. 

Re-applied for CSP, pending message, called reconsideration, said they needed address verification, faxed it, called again, approved for $9000 limit. As part of the phone call with Chase I found out I was an authorized user on one of my parents' 4-year-old credit cards, so that would have helped with the average account age.
